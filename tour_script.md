## <a name='stop-1'></a> Stop 1: Blacksburg History:
Welcome, fellow travelers, to Blacksburg, Virginia! As we navigate these charming streets, prepare to journey back in time, from a rugged frontier outpost to the vibrant university town you see today. It's a tale of ambition, education, and a few good springs!

If you look around you now, it’s hard to imagine this bustling place as a remote wilderness. But centuries ago, this area was known as Draper's Meadow, a critical stop along early westward migration routes. Pioneers were drawn to this spot by its fertile land and abundant freshwater springs – essential amenities when you're trying to build a life in the wilderness. You can almost hear the creak of wagon wheels and the rustle of untouched forests, can't you?

The true genesis of Blacksburg began in 1772 when Samuel Black purchased 600 acres in this very area. After his passing, the land was divided between his sons, John and William. Now, it was William Black who, in 1797, meticulously laid out a grid of 16 square blocks, spanning nearly 39 acres of his property. This carefully planned layout officially established the town on January 13, 1798, and yes, it was named in his honor: Blacksburg.

Interestingly, William Black had high hopes for his new town, but it didn't quite take off as quickly as he'd envisioned. In fact, he eventually packed up his family and moved to Ohio! It seems even founders can get a little impatient. However, his brother John's portion of the land would later prove to be incredibly significant, eventually becoming the majority of what is now the central campus of Virginia Tech.

And that, my friends, is where Blacksburg's trajectory truly changed. In 1872, the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College opened its doors here, thanks to the Morrill Act of 1862, which established land-grant universities. Starting with just three faculty members, this institution, now known globally as Virginia Tech, transformed Blacksburg from a quiet farming community into the dynamic college town we experience today. Its presence assured the town's steady growth and affluence.

Speaking of early buildings, did you know that the oldest building on the Virginia Tech campus, known as Solitude, actually started as a log cabin built in 1808? Imagine that frontier cabin evolving into part of a sprawling university!

As we continue, we'll dive deeper into how Virginia Tech shaped this town and explore some of the historic remnants of both its frontier past and its academic present. Get ready to discover the heart of Hokie Nation!

## <a name='stop-2'></a> Stop 2: Tazewell, Virginia: Pocahontas Coalfield:
Alright, travelers, buckle up as we leave the academic charm of Blacksburg behind and head deeper into the rugged heart of Southwest Virginia. Our next stop takes us to Tazewell, a region whose very foundation was carved, quite literally, from the earth.

**(Sound of a train whistle, distant and fading, then the gentle rumble of a vehicle on a less-traveled road.)**

As we travel, notice how the landscape begins to change, the mountains becoming more pronounced, hinting at the rich veins hidden beneath. We're entering the legendary **Pocahontas Coalfield**, a name that once echoed with the clang of picks, the roar of machinery, and the hopes and struggles of thousands.

The story of Tazewell County, and indeed much of this corner of Appalachia, is inextricably linked to coal. It was here, in the town of Pocahontas, that commercial coal mining truly began in Virginia in 1883, with the opening of Pocahontas Mine No. 1. But the coal itself had been known for much longer. Imagine, if you will, Jordan Nelson, a local blacksmith, who was the first to mine the famed Pocahontas No. 3 coal seam right out of his backyard for his forge. Talk about a convenient fuel source!

The real boom, however, ignited with the arrival of the Norfolk & Western Railway in March of 1883. Suddenly, this incredibly rich, high-quality "smokeless" coal could be transported to markets far and wide. The Pocahontas No. 3 seam, often a remarkable 13 feet thick, was considered among the best in the world. It was so good, in fact, that it was the chosen fuel for the U.S. Navy during the age of steam, particularly in World War II, because it burned hot with little visible smoke, making their ships harder to spot by enemy vessels.

This black gold transformed the region. What was once primarily a subsistence farming area rapidly shifted to a cash economy. Companies sprang up, building entire "company towns" or "coal camps" to house the influx of workers. Miners came from all corners – African Americans from the South, and immigrants from Italy, Hungary, Poland, and Greece, all seeking a better life in the depths of these mountains. This created a vibrant, if often challenging, melting pot of cultures.

Life for a coal miner was undeniably tough and dangerous. Picture the conditions: working deep underground, sometimes in seams so thick miners debated whether they preferred "tall coal," reaching above their heads, or "short coal," stooping for hours on end. The constant threat of disaster was real. Tazewell County witnessed tragic events, like the Bartley No. 1 Mine explosion in 1940, which claimed 91 lives, and the Havaco No. 9 mine explosion in 1956, killing 15 miners.

**Now, here's a poignant detail that truly speaks to the community here:** The Pocahontas Cemetery, established after a devastating mine explosion killed 114 men and boys, became the first organized burial ground in the coalfields. What's remarkable is that these miners, from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, were buried side-by-side. This was incredibly unusual for the South during that era, but it was a fitting tribute to men who lived, worked, and ultimately died together.

Today, the heyday of coal mining may have passed, with automation and changing energy landscapes dramatically reducing the workforce. The once-bustling town of Pocahontas itself is a quieter shadow of its former self. However, its legacy lives on. You can even visit the Pocahontas Exhibition Mine, a National Historic Landmark, and go underground to experience what it was like for those early miners.

As we continue our journey, we'll reflect on how this powerful industry shaped not just the economy, but the very spirit and resilience of the people in this unique part of Virginia. Next, we'll be heading towards a place where the past meets the present in an unexpected way.

## <a name='stop-3'></a> Stop 3: Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine:
Alright, fellow adventurers! We're leaving the historic coalfields of Tazewell and venturing deeper into West Virginia, towards a truly immersive experience. Get ready to step back in time, and literally, underground!

**(Sound of a gentle hum, perhaps an old electric motor, then the distinct "clack-clack" of a slow-moving train on tracks.)**

If you look ahead, you'll soon see signs for the **Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine**. This isn't just a museum; it's a unique opportunity to descend into the earth and experience what life was like for the brave men who powered our nation.

The mine you're about to explore, originally known as the Phillips-Sprague Mine, first opened its shafts around 1889. For years, it was a "drift mine," meaning miners accessed the rich coal seams through horizontal tunnels dug directly into the hillside. Commercial mining here really took off in 1906, and for nearly 50 years, this mine was a hive of activity, providing the high-quality coal that fueled industries and homes. In fact, coal from mines like this one was even shipped to Hampton, Virginia, and used to fuel the U.S. Navy's ships! Remember how we discussed the high-quality 'smokeless' coal from the Pocahontas Coalfield was favored by the U.S. Navy? This is another example of that vital connection!

Today, the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine stands as a testament to that incredible history. After closing in 1953, the property was purchased by the City of Beckley, and by 1962, it had transformed into the fascinating educational site we visit today.

Your journey begins as you board a "mantrip" – that's a small, open train, for the uninitiated – and rumble over 1500 feet into the mountain, about 150 to 200 feet below the surface. Brace yourself, because down here, the temperature stays a constant, cool 58 degrees year-round, so that jacket you brought will come in handy! As you travel through the preserved shafts, past old machinery and exposed coal seams, you'll learn about the evolution of mining, from the early days of hand augers and black powder blasts to the more mechanized methods.

The best part? Your guides are often retired coal miners themselves. They'll regale you with firsthand accounts, sharing stories, trivia, and even a few jokes about life underground. Imagine working in conditions so dark and damp, sometimes on your knees in "short coal" seams, where the constant threat of falling slate was a grim reality. Just like the general hardships and dangers we touched upon in Tazewell, these miners faced incredible challenges daily. Miners in the early 1900s earned about $.20 per ton of coal, but much of that often went straight back to the company store for housing and food, leading to a cycle of debt – a harsh reality immortalized in songs like "Sixteen Tons".

Now, for a truly unique piece of miner folklore: did you know that many miners believed rats had a "sixth sense" about danger? If you saw a group of rats suddenly scurrying past you deeper into the mine, it was a clear signal to run the same way – you were likely just minutes, if not seconds, from a potential disaster! Many a miner owed his life to those tiny, four-legged alarm systems.

Beyond the mine itself, the site also features a recreated coal camp. Just like the company towns we discussed in Tazewell, this site features a recreated coal camp where you can explore restored buildings like a miner's humble home, a church, a doctor's office, and a schoolhouse, offering a glimpse into the daily lives of these tight-knit communities. There's even a lavish superintendent's mansion, moved here from a nearby coal town, showcasing the different ends of the social spectrum in a company town.

As we emerge from the depths and reflect on the incredible resilience of these mining communities, we'll continue our journey, heading towards a place that celebrates the natural beauty and adventurous spirit of West Virginia.

## <a name='stop-4'></a> Stop 4: Grandview State Park Overlook:
Alright, adventurers, take a deep breath and prepare for a view that will truly steal it away! We're now arriving at the **Grandview State Park Overlook**, and if you look out now, you'll understand exactly how it got its name.

**(Sound of a gentle breeze, perhaps a hawk cry in the distance, emphasizing the vastness.)**

From this incredible vantage point, perched 1400 feet above the New River, you’re treated to one of the most breathtaking panoramas in the entire New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. Notice the sheer scale of it all – seven miles of the New River winding like a ribbon through lush, ancient forests, carved deep into the Appalachian Plateau. On a clear day, you can see directly into the very heart of this magnificent landscape.

Grandview has been a cherished recreational spot for generations. Its story as a public park began in 1939 when the state of West Virginia purchased 52 acres of this stunning land. Soon after, the diligent hands of the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC boys as they were affectionately known, began to shape what you see today. These young men, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "New Deal" during the Great Depression, built many of the roads, shelters, and picnic areas that are still in use. Imagine them, working tirelessly for just $30 a month – with $25 of that often sent home to their families – creating beauty that would last for decades.

In the 1960s, Grandview continued to flourish, with the addition of the impressive 1200-seat Cliffside Amphitheater, children’s playgrounds, and more walkways. For over 50 years, it was one of West Virginia’s most popular state parks, a place for family picnics, hiking, and spectacular outdoor dramas. Then, in 1990, Grandview was proudly transferred to the National Park Service, becoming an integral part of the larger New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.

Now, let's talk about the geological marvel beneath our feet. The New River Gorge itself is a V-shaped canyon, sculpted by the relentless power of erosion over an almost unimaginable span of time. This river exposes over 3,200 feet of incredibly old rock layers, mostly sandstone and shale, that tell a story dating back 320 to 330 million years. These sediments slowly accumulated as layers of sand, mud, and ancient plant matter – much like the organic material that eventually formed the coal we explored in Tazewell and Beckley – eventually compressing into the solid rock you see today.

Here's a fun fact that might make you chuckle: Despite its name, the New River is actually considered one of the oldest rivers in North America, possibly even dating back 320 million years! It's thought to be a remnant of the ancient Teays River system, which flowed long before the Appalachian Mountains even fully formed. So, "New River" is about as misleading as calling a dinosaur "Sparky"!

As you take in these sweeping views, perhaps in late May you might even catch the vibrant purple bloom of the Catawba rhododendrons that carpet the area, adding another layer of beauty to this ancient landscape.

From this perspective, you can truly appreciate the forces of nature and the dedicated efforts of people who preserved this "Grand View" for all of us. As we continue our journey, we’ll delve deeper into the natural wonders that make West Virginia truly wild and wonderful. Next up, we’ll be heading to another iconic natural landmark.

## <a name='stop-5'></a> Stop 5: New River Gorge Bridge Construction:
**(Sound of a dramatic, sweeping orchestral swell, then a sudden, sharp gust of wind, followed by the distant clang of metal on metal.)**

Alright, buckle up, everyone! Remember how we talked about the immense age and depth of the New River Gorge at Grandview, a chasm carved over millions of years? Well, as we approach our next destination, prepare to gaze upon a true titan of engineering, a structure built to conquer that very same ancient chasm and bridge a significant divide in West Virginia's history: the **New River Gorge Bridge**.

If you look ahead, you’ll soon see it rise, a magnificent, rust-colored arch against the verdant backdrop of the gorge. This isn't just a bridge; it's a testament to human ingenuity, born from the sheer challenge of this rugged landscape.

Before this marvel existed, traversing the New River Gorge was quite the expedition. Picture this: a winding, narrow, often treacherous road that could take up to 45 minutes just to get from one side to the other. It was famously called a "four-cigarette" drive by one local guide! The idea of a bridge to conquer this natural barrier was a dream for decades.

Construction on this ambitious project began in June 1974, and it took three intense years to complete, finally opening on October 22, 1977. Designed by the Michael Baker Company and built by U.S. Steel’s American Bridge Division, this wasn't just any bridge. At 3,030 feet long and an astounding 876 feet above the New River, it was, at the time, the longest single-span arch bridge in the world and the highest bridge east of the Mississippi. Imagine the audacity of such a design!

Building this colossal arch was an incredible feat. Engineers ruled out traditional scaffolding due to the gorge's immense depth. Instead, they employed innovative techniques, most notably a massive four-tower cableway system. This "bridge to build a bridge" stretched 3,500 feet across the gorge, using airborne trolleys and cables to hoist enormous steel sections into place, some weighing up to 92 tons. Workers also used a unique "tie-back" system to support the arch halves as they were cantilevered out from both sides, meeting precisely in the middle.

The bridge is constructed from a special high-strength, corrosion-resistant material called COR-TEN steel. This steel naturally oxidizes, forming a protective, rust-like layer that gives the bridge its distinctive dark russet color and, remarkably, eliminates the need for painting. This not only saved an estimated $300,000 in initial costs but also millions in future maintenance, allowing the bridge to blend seamlessly with its natural surroundings.

Of course, such a monumental undertaking wasn't without its perils. There were stories circulating about the potential need for Mohawk "high steel" workers and a construction insurance policy that projected six deaths. Thankfully, only one fatality occurred during construction, in a tragic accident on the sloping ground of the gorge.

The impact of the New River Gorge Bridge on transportation and the local economy was nothing short of revolutionary. What once took 45 minutes of white-knuckle driving was reduced to a mere 45 seconds! It connected previously isolated communities and transformed the region, boosting tourism and making the New River Gorge accessible to the world.

**Here's a fun fact for you:** The New River Gorge Bridge is so iconic that it was featured on the West Virginia state quarter in 2005 and has even been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its exceptional engineering significance, despite not yet being 50 years old! And every third Saturday in October, the bridge closes to vehicles for "Bridge Day," West Virginia's largest one-day festival, where thousands of spectators gather to watch hundreds of BASE jumpers parachute into the gorge below! Talk about taking a leap of faith!

As we continue our journey, reflect on the sheer scale of this achievement, a true symbol of West Virginia's wild and wonderful spirit. Next, we'll head towards a place where the adrenaline continues to flow, but this time, on the water.

## <a name='stop-7'></a> Stop 7: Hawks Nest State Park Tragedy:
Alright, adventurers, we’ve just explored the impressive feat of the New River Gorge Bridge and the natural splendor of the Canyon Rim. But as we continue our journey along these stunning West Virginia roads, we're about to turn a page to a much darker, yet incredibly significant, chapter in American industrial history.

**(Sound of a pickaxe hitting rock, then a distant, muffled cough, gradually fading.)**

We’re heading towards the area of the **Hawks Nest Tunnel**, a place where ambition met tragedy on a scale almost unimaginable. This wasn't a natural disaster, but a man-made one, born from a reckless pursuit of progress that cost hundreds of lives.

In 1930, construction began on a three-mile-long tunnel through Gauley Mountain, between Ansted and Gauley Bridge, West Virginia. The purpose? To divert water from the New River to a hydroelectric plant downstream, generating power for Union Carbide's metallurgical facility in Alloy. It was a monumental undertaking, but one that would become known as one of the worst industrial tragedies in U.S. history.

As thousands of unemployed men, many of them African American migrants from the South, were recruited for the project during the Great Depression, they faced conditions that were horrifying even by the standards of the time. The tunnel was being drilled through rock containing exceptionally high levels of silica, sometimes more than 90% pure. Instead of using wet drilling, which could have suppressed the deadly dust, the company prioritized speed and opted for dry drilling.

Imagine the scene inside the tunnel: a constant, thick, white cloud of silica dust, impairing vision and relentlessly clogging the lungs of the workers. They labored in confined spaces with poor ventilation, no dust control, and virtually no personal breathing protection. Workers were often forced to work 10- or 15-hour shifts. Many Black workers, doing the most grueling jobs at the tunnel face, reported being denied breaks and even forced to work at gunpoint by "shack rousters." Meanwhile, supervisors were seen wearing safety equipment during their inspection visits.

Within months, men began to fall sick, experiencing shortness of breath, persistent coughs, chest pain, and fatigue. They were suffering from acute silicosis, a progressive and incurable lung disease caused by inhaling pulverized silica. Doctors, perhaps unaware or pressured, often misdiagnosed it as "tunnelitis" or "tunnel pneumonia." Many workers lasted only a few months before becoming too ill to continue, often being fired and evicted from company housing.

The death toll is truly staggering and still debated, but all estimates point to an immense loss of life. While the company initially acknowledged only 109 deaths, a 1936 congressional investigation placed the figure at 476. Later studies, like one by epidemiologist Martin Cherniack, estimated as many as 764 deaths from acute silicosis, and some reports suggest it could be close to 1,000. This makes it the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history due to silicosis.

The legal and social consequences were profound. Cora Jones was one of the first to file suit in 1932, having lost her husband and three sons to the disease. Ultimately, 538 lawsuits were filed against the contractor, Rinehart and Dennis, and Union Carbide's subsidiary, New Kanawha Power. However, the out-of-court settlement was a modest $130,000 to $200,000, with individual awards ranging from just $30 to $1,600, often based on ethnicity and marital status. Think about that for a moment: individual awards that barely covered a few weeks' wages, often reflecting the stark realities of racial and social hierarchies. It’s a chilling reminder of the economic exploitation we discussed at the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine, where miners faced a similar cycle of debt and meager pay, a struggle immortalized in songs like "Sixteen Tons." The House of Representatives Committee on Labor concluded that the tunnel was built with "grave and inhuman disregard" for the workers' health and lives.

**Here's a truly heartbreaking detail:** Because many of the deceased were African American workers, and local "white" cemeteries would not accept them, some were buried unceremoniously in unmarked graves in a field on Martha White's farm in Summersville. These graves were later disturbed and moved when U.S. Route 19 was widened, with remains placed in child-sized coffins for reburial. This stands in stark contrast to the Pocahontas Cemetery we visited in Tazewell, where miners of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds were buried side-by-side, a truly unusual and poignant act of solidarity for the South during that era. The injustice here at Hawks Nest, unfortunately, highlighted a very different reality.

Despite the engineering success of the tunnel, which still generates electricity today, the Hawks Nest tragedy became a catalyst for change. It brought national attention to acute silicosis as an occupational disease and prompted congressional inquiries that eventually led to reforms in worker protection and the expansion of the Bureau of Mines' authority over underground work.

As we leave this somber, yet crucial, historical site, let's carry forward the lessons learned from this devastating chapter. Next, we'll shift our focus to the natural wonders of the New River, where you can experience its power and beauty firsthand. Get ready to hit the rapids!
